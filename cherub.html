        <p>James Choke comes from a dysfunctional family, and is often in trouble at school.
             When his mother dies, James is sent to a children's home, but here he is recruited into the ranks of CHERUB 
             - a secret organisation established during World War II, which trains children between ten and seventeen as spies.
              CHERUB agents live in the real world, slipping under the adult radar and collecting information that sends
               criminals and terrorists to jail - and for official purposes, these children do not exist.
