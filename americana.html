        <p>In Americanah, a young Nigerian woman, Ifemelu, moves to the United States for school, leaving behind her boyfriend, Obinze, and her family
            . It's a story of relocation, far-flung love and life as an alien, spread across three continents. 
            It's also about the lonely but privileged perspective a stranger gains by entering a new culture.
             Indeed, it's more powerful than that in Americanah, because Ifemelu experiences America both as a black woman
              and as an African woman. In the U.S.,
             those two identities combine for experiences dark and light that Adichie skillfully renders in gray scale.
