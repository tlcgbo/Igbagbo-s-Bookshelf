        <p>John Smith is on the run from enemies. His enemies are trying to slaughter the last of his race.
             John is one of eighteen refugees from the planet Lorien. The nine children and their nine guards 
             are the last of their race. They are on the run from an evil group called the Mogadorians until their
              legacies develop. Legacies are special powers that develop as they mature. Before leaving Lorien, a charm 
              was placed on them so they can only be killed in a particular order and it notifies the others when one of 
              them has died. Three are dead. John Smith is number four. They are coming for him.
