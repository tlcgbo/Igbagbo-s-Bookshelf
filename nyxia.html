        <p>In Reintgen’s energetic debut
            , a Detroit teen is offered an extraordinary opportunity by corporate giant Babel
             Communications to earn more than enough money to bring his family out of poverty
              and get his mother needed medical care. Emmett Atwater, who is black, and nine
               other teens from across the world are eager to travel to Eden, an Earthlike planet
                that is home to humanoid beings called Adamites. There, they’ll mine for a sought-after
                 substance called nyxia, which can transform itself into just about anything. But only eight can go, and they must fight for the privilege. Emmett isn’t about to lose, but winning becomes harder as he starts to care about his competitors, especially his sweet-natured Japanese
                  roommate, Kaya, and the kindly Bilal, from the West Bank.
