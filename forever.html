        <p>Q and Jamal have a lot in common. They have always been best friends
            , they share ‘Jauncy’ – a video-sharing platform channel where they upload their comedy videos
             – and they both experience parental loss. Jamal’s parents die in a car accident
             ; he blames Q for that but never tells him that and, by the time Q’s dad receives a terminal diagnosis
             , they are estranged from one another. On the night the boys come together to try and bring closure to their relationship, Q dies abruptly
             . Thanks to a recent and obscure healthcare technology discovery, Q is reanimated and Jamal has a second chance to say goodbye to his lifetime best friend.
